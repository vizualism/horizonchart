Horizon charts combine position and color to reduce vertical space. Start with a standard area chart, then **mirror** negative values (in blue) or **offset** them vertically. Click the **+ button** above to increase the number of bands, turning the area into a horizon.

Implemented with the [d3.horizon](https://github.com/d3/d3-plugins/tree/master/horizon) plugin.
